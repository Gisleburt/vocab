# Vocab

A command line application for learning vocabulary in new languages

## Usage:

### Initialising:

`init` will create a bew vocab.sqlite file in the current directory. We recommend you use
directories to label which language you're learning.

Example:

```shell
mkdir japanese
cd japanese
vocab init
```

This will help you separate and organise multiple languages.

### Adding new words

`add <local> <foreign>` will let you add a new word as you learn it. `<local>` should be the
word in your own language, `<foreign>` should be the word in the language you are learning.

Example:

```shell
vocab add japan 日本
```
